# Hi, I'm Segni Mekonnen

Computer Science student at Minnesota State University, Mankato. Currently working as an AI/ML Intern at Outamation and leading a research team building AutoML systems. I build backend systems with Python and FastAPI, and I've contributed to Django.

## What I'm Working On

- AI/ML Intern at Outamation, AI & Document Intelligence Team (Dec. 2025 – Present)
- Machine Learning Research Assistant / Team Lead at Minnesota State University (Jan. 2025 – Present)
- Open source contributions to Django framework

## Experience

**AI/ML Intern** — Outamation, AI & Document Intelligence Team  
Dec. 2025 – Present | Remote

Building Python pipelines for mortgage-document understanding, blob classification, and automated document routing. Working on OCR and layout-aware extraction systems, evaluating multiple OCR engines and creating structured-data pipelines. Also implementing RAG-based retrieval workflows and integrating LLM prompt engineering into a Gradio chatbot.

**Machine Learning Research Assistant / Team Lead** — Minnesota State University, Mankato  
Jan. 2025 – Present | Mankato, MN

Leading a team of four to build a Python-based AutoML system that automates model training and evaluation for insurance prediction. Developed data preprocessing and model comparison pipelines using pandas and scikit-learn, tested five ML algorithms and analyzed performance metrics. Containerized workflows with Docker to improve reproducibility and reduce environment setup time by ~40%.

**Open Source Software Developer** — Django Software Foundation  
Aug. 2025 – Oct. 2025 | Remote

Fixed a core template parsing bug (PR #19944) after running 1,500+ unit tests. Improved error handling for invalid numeric literals. Also authored advanced ORM documentation (PR #36657) that clarifies query optimization and Manager usage for developers. My contributions were merged into Django's main branch.

## Projects

**Habit Loop – ML-Powered Habit Tracker** | FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, scikit-learn, Docker | June 2025

Built a full-stack habit tracking app with a machine learning backend that predicts user consistency from historical data. Developed REST APIs with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, trained Random Forest models that got 96% accuracy for real-time predictions. Containerized with Docker and deployed on Render. React frontend visualizes progress through dynamic charts.

**Real-Time Chat Application** | FastAPI, WebSockets, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Redis | March 2025

Team project where I collaborated with a 3-member team to design and deploy a real-time messaging system. Implemented WebSocket integration and async message broadcasting using FastAPI and Redis pub/sub. Added JWT authentication and containerized deployment for scalable, low-latency communication.

**Weather Dashboard API** | FastAPI, HTTPX, OpenWeatherMap API, CSS Grid | December 2024

Integrated OpenWeatherMap API with async HTTP requests and caching for reliable data retrieval. Built a responsive UI and deployed frontend on GitHub Pages for cross-device accessibility.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL (PostgreSQL)  
**Frameworks:** FastAPI, React, SQLAlchemy, Docker  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, PyCharm, Render, Cursor  
**Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

## Education
