        Dear Hiring Manager,
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the Windchill Application Developer position at Systems Innovation Engineering. As a Computer Information Technology student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, with a passion for backend development and enterprise software solutions, I am excited about contributing to SIE's mission of improving defense system affordability and mission readiness.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        While my experience has primarily been in Python-based development with FastAPI, React, and modern web technologies, I am eager to expand my expertise into enterprise PLM systems like Windchill. My strong foundation in backend development, database design, and API integration provides an excellent base for learning specialized enterprise software. I have successfully built full-stack applications with complex data management, real-time communication systems, and scalable architectures—skills that translate directly to enterprise software development.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        My recent projects demonstrate my ability to work with complex systems and deliver production-ready solutions. I developed a real-time chat application achieving sub-100ms latency using WebSocket connections and JWT authentication, a weather dashboard API with intelligent caching that reduced external API calls by 90%, and an ML-powered habit tracking system with 85% prediction accuracy. These projects showcase my problem-solving abilities, attention to performance optimization, and commitment to building reliable, scalable software—qualities essential for defense industry applications.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        What particularly attracts me to SIE is your focus on systems engineering and the opportunity to work on solutions that directly impact mission readiness. As someone who enjoys schema design, authentication/authorization, and serving models for inference, I am excited about applying these skills to enterprise PLM systems that support critical defense operations. I am committed to learning Windchill development, Java, JSP, and XML technologies, and I am confident that my strong analytical skills and collaborative approach will enable me to quickly contribute to your team.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills, passion for backend development, and eagerness to learn enterprise software technologies can contribute to SIE's continued success. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.
