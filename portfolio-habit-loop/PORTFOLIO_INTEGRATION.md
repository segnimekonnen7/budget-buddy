### 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

#### Q: "What was the most challenging part of this project?"
**A:** "The most challenging aspect was implementing the contextual bandit algorithm for adaptive reminder timing. I had to research reinforcement learning concepts, design the feature engineering pipeline, and ensure the system could learn and adapt in real-time without impacting performance. The solution involved creating a custom ML service that integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture."

#### Q: "How did you ensure code quality and maintainability?"
**A:** "I implemented several strategies: TypeScript for type safety, comprehensive testing with 85% coverage, Pydantic for data validation, and event sourcing for debugging. I also used automated tools like ESLint and Prettier, and created detailed documentation. The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features without breaking existing functionality."

#### Q: "What would you do differently if you started over?"
**A:** "I would implement a more robust caching layer earlier, perhaps with Redis, and add more comprehensive monitoring and alerting. I'd also consider implementing a more sophisticated ML pipeline with feature stores and model versioning. The current architecture is solid, but these additions would make it even more production-ready."
