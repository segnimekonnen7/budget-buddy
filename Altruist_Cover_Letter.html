    <div class="salutation">
        <p>Dear Altruist Hiring Team,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Intern position for Summer 2026 at Altruist. As a Computer Information Technology student with a Mathematics minor at Minnesota State University, Mankato (graduating 2026), I am passionate about building scalable systems that make a meaningful impact—values that align perfectly with Altruist's mission to make financial advice better, more affordable, and accessible to everyone.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        My technical foundation includes hands-on experience with modern tech stacks including Python, Java, React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and AWS—technologies that directly align with Altruist's infrastructure. I have built production-ready applications including a real-time chat system with WebSocket connections achieving sub-100ms latency, a weather dashboard API that reduced external calls by 90% through intelligent caching, and a full-stack habit tracking application with ML-powered insights. These projects demonstrate my ability to write high-quality, scalable code and work through complex technical challenges from design to deployment.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        Beyond technical skills, I embody Altruist's core values through my leadership experience as a Scout Leader during the 2017 National Jamboree, where I coordinated team activities and developed conflict resolution skills. My academic achievements—including Dean's List recognition and scholarship recipient status—reflect my commitment to excellence and continuous learning. I thrive in collaborative environments, as evidenced by my contribution to an open-source NLP project with Omdena, where I improved model performance by 12% while collaborating with 15+ data scientists using agile methodologies.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Altruist's growth phase and learn from experienced engineers while working on projects that directly impact financial advisors and their clients. The 10-week program structure, combining sprint tasks with dedicated projects, aligns perfectly with my goal of gaining hands-on experience in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. I am confident that my technical aptitude, problem-solving skills, and alignment with Altruist's mission make me an ideal candidate for this internship.
    </div>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion for building impactful software can contribute to Altruist's continued success. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
