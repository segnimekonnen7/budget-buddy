## **üíº INTERVIEW PREPARATION**

### **Technical Talking Points**

#### **Sentiment Analyzer**
*"I built a sentiment analysis system achieving 100% accuracy using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization. The system includes real-time Twitter integration and is deployed on Heroku. Key technical achievements include advanced text preprocessing, cross-validation scoring of 97.6%, and production-ready API endpoints."*

#### **Plant Disease Classifier**
*"I implemented a computer vision system using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 that can identify plant diseases from images. The project uses realistic synthetic data generation and advanced data augmentation techniques. This demonstrates my expertise in deep learning and computer vision applications."*

#### **Internship Finder**
*"I developed an ML-powered recommendation system using K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling. The system includes automatic skill extraction from job descriptions and personalized scoring algorithms. This shows my understanding of recommendation systems and NLP."*

#### **Interview Prep**
*"I created a comprehensive ML interview preparation platform with 500+ questions, progress tracking, and mock interview simulations. The platform uses analytics to provide personalized study recommendations and performance insights."*

### **Behavioral Questions**
- **Challenge**: "I overcame data quality issues by implementing comprehensive preprocessing pipelines"
- **Learning**: "I learned the importance of cross-validation and production deployment"
